Abstract: 
This paper presents Serve at Ease, a privacy-first framework that integrates federated learning with a 
transparent trust-scoring pipeline for service platforms to mitigate data exposure, bias, and fraud while 
maintaining scalability. Unlike centralized analytics that aggregate raw user and vendor data, the 
system coordinates decentralized model training on edge nodes and exchanges only anonymized 
model updates for aggregation, aligning with modern FL practices. The literature review synthesizes 
advances in federated optimization, trust and reputation modeling, and bias mitigation in marketplace 
platforms, then operationalizes these concepts for real-time fraud alerts and role-aware analytics. A 
partially implemented prototype demonstrates role-based interfaces (customer, vendor, admin), secure 
authentication, baseline schemas for trust and model states, and an orchestrator for update intake and 
global model distribution. The approach is designed to enhance user confidence, reduce manipulation, 
and align with deployment constraints, while enabling future integration of blockchain-backed update 
attestation and large-scale evaluation.

1. Introduction 
Service marketplaces depend on reliable interactions among customers, vendors, and platform 
operators, yet centralized data pipelines amplify risks such as privacy leakage, adversarial 
manipulation, and latency in fraud response. Conventional machine learning pipelines typically 
require central collection of behavior logs and transactions, which in turn increases compliance 
burden and single-point failures. Federated learning (FL) addresses these concerns by training models 
at the data origin and transmitting learned parameters for secure aggregation, thus limiting raw data 
movement while preserving utility. Serve at Ease applies this principle to trust and fraud analytics in 
service platforms, providing a streamed, privacy-preserving alternative to traditional reputation 
engines. The contributions are threefold: a literature-anchored system design for FL-based trust 
scoring in marketplaces; an orchestrated backend enabling secure update flow and global model 
distribution; and an implementation-in-progress showcasing role-based dashboards, authentication, 
and baseline data schemas for trust and models. 
2. Literature review 
2.1 Federated learning foundations 
Federated learning introduced decentralized optimization where clients train locally and share model 
updates to an aggregator, reducing raw data exposure. Subsequent work generalized FL to domains 
with strict privacy and compliance requirements, including healthcare, finance, and IoT, emphasizing 
communication efficiency, client heterogeneity, and robustness. These advances motivate applying FL 
to marketplaces in which user and vendor data sensitivity is high and participation is dynamic. 
2.2 Trust, reputation, and fraud analytics 
Trust computation has evolved from probabilistic and evidence-based formulations to deep behavioral 
models that infer reliability from interactions, temporal patterns, and anomalies. Reputation systems 
in consumer platforms face manipulation, selection bias, and echo effects, and centralized curation 
can introduce opaque decisions. Integrating trust models with streaming anomaly detection is 
beneficial for early fraud signals and adaptive scoring. 
2.3 FL combined with trust scoring 
Emerging studies propose merging decentralized learning with trust/reputation signals to reduce data 
exposure and limit systemic bias from centralized curation. Aggregation-time defenses, differential 
privacy, and secure aggregation help resist gradient leakage and model inversion, while robust 
aggregation can mitigate poisoned updates from malicious clients. For service platforms, this 
integration aims to provide privacy-aware evaluations with resilience to gaming and model drift. 
2.4 Gaps and implications for marketplaces 
Across the literature, observed gaps include limited end-to-end prototypes with real user roles, sparse 
reporting on admin-facing fraud workflows, and insufficient life-cycle governance of models and 
reputational feedback loops. Serve at Ease addresses these gaps by combining federated training 
orchestration, trust score computation, and an admin dashboard for monitoring anomalies and model 
behaviour, providing a practical bridge from theory to deployment. 
3. Proposed system architecture 
Overview 
Serve at Ease coordinates local model training on user and vendor devices, transmits only encrypted 
gradients/weights, and aggregates updates to refine a global model that supports trust scoring and 
fraud alerts. The platform returns updated parameters and trust metrics to clients via secure APIs, 
enabling privacy-preserving, iterative improvements. 
Key modules 
• Data locality: Devices retain logs such as bookings, ratings, reviews, and behavioural signals 
to ensure privacy and regulatory alignment. 
• Local model training: Lightweight models learn on-device from behavioural data to identify 
trustworthy and anomalous patterns. 
• Update sharing: Clients send encrypted model updates rather than raw records, reducing 
leakage risk. 
• Global aggregation: The backend orchestrator aggregates client updates and produces a 
refreshed global model. 
• Trust scoring: The platform computes trust scores informed by consistency, completion 
quality, feedback integrity, and anomaly signals. 
Technologies 
• Frontend: React + Vite 
• Backend: Node.js + Express 
• Database: MongoDB (User, TrustScore, GlobalModel, LocalUpdate) 
• Federated AI: TensorFlow Federated / PySyft (simulations during development) 
• Security: JWT authentication, encrypted transport for updates 
System flow 
User/Vendor Device → Local Model (on private data) → Encrypted Updates → Federated 
Orchestrator (Aggregation) → Updated Global Model → Trust Score Update at Client/Server 
4. Methodology 
4.1 Federated orchestrator (backend API) 
The orchestrator mediates update intake and distribution of the current global model snapshot. Clients 
submit updates through a secure endpoint and retrieve the latest global parameters when eligible. 
Aggregation strategies can be configured (e.g., weighted averaging, robust aggregation) and 
instrumented for audit and rollback. Example endpoints: 
• POST /federated/update — submit encrypted gradients/weights 
• GET /federated/global-model — fetch the latest global model state 
4.2 Trust scoring engine 
The engine computes user/vendor trust scores using multi-factor signals: transaction completion rates, 
dispute/cancellation ratios, timeliness/service quality, feedback credibility, and anomaly indicators. 
Scores are recalibrated as the global model improves. Example endpoint: 
• GET /trust-score/:id — retrieve current trust score and summary factors 
4.3 Authentication and role management 
A JWT-based access layer enforces roles for customers, vendors, and admins. Core endpoints: 
• POST /auth/register — create account with role binding 
• POST /auth/login — obtain JWT token for protected APIs 
4.4 Admin control panel 
The admin dashboard surfaces: 
• Live system statistics and user/vendor activity 
• Real-time fraud alerts and anomaly feeds 
• Global model performance summaries and update volumes 
• Aggregated trust trends and segments 
4.5 Model integration and analytics 
Python-backed models (e.g., XGBoost, TensorFlow) support: 
• Fraud likelihood scoring 
• Demand forecasting for services 
• Vendor performance evaluation and drift checks 
Model updates are logged with version metadata to support rollbacks, audits, and A/B tests.
